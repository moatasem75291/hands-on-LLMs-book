# Chapter 2 Summary: Tokens, Embeddings, and Their Relationship to Language Models

This chapter provides a foundational understanding of **tokens** and **embeddings**, two central concepts for comprehending how Large Language Models (LLMs) function. It explores the crucial relationship between these concepts in the context of how LLMs process and understand language.

## Key Concepts:

- **Tokens as Input:** LLMs process text by first breaking it down into smaller units called **tokens** using a **tokenizer**. The tokenizer follows a specific method and training procedure. Examples show how text is split into words or parts of words, and even punctuation can be a token. The tokenizer outputs a sequence of **token IDs**.
- **Embeddings as Numeric Representation:** To compute and understand language, LLMs convert these token IDs into **numeric representations called embeddings**. Each token in the tokenizer's vocabulary has an associated **embedding vector**, which is a dense, real-valued vector capturing semantic meaning. The language model looks up these embeddings using the token IDs as input.
- **The Sequential Process:** The transformation from text to understanding involves:
  - **Tokenization:** Input text is broken into token IDs.
  - **Embedding Lookup:** The LLM retrieves the embedding vector for each token ID from its **embeddings matrix**.
  - **Computation:** The LLM processes these embeddings to learn patterns and generate output.
- **Contextualized Word Embeddings:** Modern LLMs generate **contextualized word embeddings**, where a token's representation varies based on its surrounding words, allowing for more nuanced meaning capture.
- **Text Embeddings:** Beyond token embeddings, models can also produce **text embeddings**, single vectors representing entire sentences or documents, enabling tasks like semantic search.
- **Word Embeddings (Pre-LLMs):** The chapter discusses earlier methods like **word2vec** that generated static word embeddings based on word co-occurrence. These methods used techniques like **skip-gram** and **negative sampling**.
- **Embeddings Beyond LLMs:** The concept of embeddings is also valuable in other domains, such as **recommendation systems**, where items (like songs) can be represented as vectors based on their co-occurrence in playlists.

## Tokenizer Properties and Design:

The way a tokenizer breaks down text depends on several factors:

- **Tokenization Method:** Different algorithms exist, including **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** (used by GPT models) and **WordPiece** (used by BERT). Other methods include word, character, and byte tokenization. **Subword tokenization** is the most common.
- **Tokenizer Parameters:** These include **vocabulary size** (number of tokens in the vocabulary) and **special tokens** (e.g., beginning/end of text, padding, unknown tokens). Handling of **capitalization** is also a key parameter.
- **Domain of the Data:** The dataset the tokenizer is trained on significantly influences its behavior, as seen in the differences between tokenizers for general text versus code. Specialized models like StarCoder2 and Galactica have tokenizers tailored for code and scientific text, respectively, including special tokens for repository names, filenames, citations, and mathematical expressions.

## Importance and Next Steps:

Understanding tokens and embeddings is **essential for grasping how LLMs process language, are built, and their future direction**. This chapter has laid the groundwork for the next chapter, which will delve into **how LLMs process these tokens and generate text**, focusing on the Transformer architecture.
