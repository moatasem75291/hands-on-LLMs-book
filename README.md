# Hands-On LLMs 📘🤖

Welcome to my journey through the book **"Hands-On LLMs"**!  
This repository will serve as a living collection of everything I learn, including:

- 📓 Jupyter notebooks with practical code examples  
- 🧠 Mind maps to visualize key concepts  
- 📝 Notes and summaries from each chapter  
- 🛠️ Experiments and side projects inspired by the book

## Why this repo?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are shaping the future of AI.  
This book offers a hands-on approach, and I'm using this repo to track my progress, apply what I learn, and hopefully help others who are exploring the same path.
